I'm ex-civil engineer who changed his "career" to be a programmer. I am working in JVM ecosystem, mostly as Java Developer.
I am very into architecture and refactoring topics. That's why I share my knowledge about these topics on 
[my blog (it's in Polish)](https://cezarysanecki.pl/?utm_source=github_profile).

I really love to teach others! I do it by giving speeches (beginner) and writing blog posts on my blog and on LinkedIn.
Also I've recorded [tutorial about Java basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR30MK4JIV8&t=3s&ab_channel=DevCezz) (also in Polish).

🛡️ My mission: <strong>To make all programmers write better code.</strong>
